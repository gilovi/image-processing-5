NOTE:
-----
In the getImage file I applied some anti loop black magic.

My examples:
------------
butterfly:
-=-=-=-=-=- 
1. the procedure keeps mostly big patterns and patterns that are repetitive.
for example, the wings shape, the black marks on the butterfly's wings etc.

2. the finer details such that smaller images in the pyramid would loose, are lost.
for example,the round shape of the marks is distorted, the fine lines in the upper 
right mark, the round shape of the tip of the wing etc

small_minion:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1. this is a cartoon with small amount of colors and clean shapes, so the most 
of the details remain...

2. we can still see some color quantization on the minion's pants.
once again, round objects gets distorted, the glasses, the eyes, etc.

monument:
-=-=-=-=
1. the floor and the poles are repetitive so it is nicely restored,
2. the grass on the left and basically everything outside the main corridor,
got some color quantization, and looks like an oil painting...
